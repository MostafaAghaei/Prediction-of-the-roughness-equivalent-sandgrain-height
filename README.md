# Prediction-of-the-equivalent-sandgrain-height

## Description
This repository is prepared to predict the roughness equivalent sandgrain height, k<sub>s</sub>, using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are employed to predict k<sub>s</sub> as a functon of roughness geometrical parameters.
