# Prediction-of-the-equivalent-sandgrain-height

## Description
This repository is prepared to predict the roughness equivalent sandgrain height, k<sub>s</sub>, using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. 
Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are employed to predict k<sub>s</sub> as a functon of roughness geometrical parameters.

#### Folder 1 
Please consulte with this folder if you are intersted to use the already trained verion of ML networks and predict k<sub>s</sub> for your surface.

#### Folder 2 
Please consulte with this folder if you are intersted to train your own version of ML networks. This folder contains some helper codes that can receive arbitrary geometrical parameters and train DNN and GPR networks to predict k<sub>s</sub>. 

#### Folder 3 
Please consulte with this folder if you are intersted in our database, but and want to use it for any desired application of yours!

#### Please condult with README.md in each sub-folders.
