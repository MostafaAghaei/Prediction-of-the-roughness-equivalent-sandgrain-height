# Description

The databse are stored in `Database` folder. It contains 46 roughness topographies and their equivalent sandgrain height. The details of simulations and roughness features are explained extensively in our paper.

It is recommended to consider surfaces with k<sub>s</sub><sup>+</sup>>50
